# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-
A project in Deep Learning subject for recognizing sign boards on road with the help of ML Algorithms

The methodology of recognizing which class a traffic sign belongs to is called Traffic signs classification.
In this Deep Learning project, we will build a model for the classification of traffic signs available in the image into many categories using a convolutional neural network(CNN) and Keras library
**We Use ResNet Model to train and test the model and we get suceed with good Accuracy in Results.
**ResNet uses skip connection to add the output from an earlierlayer to a later layer. This helps it mitigate the vanishinggradient problem
